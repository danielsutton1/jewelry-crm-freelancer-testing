# Challenge 4 Solution Explanation

## Your Solution
*Please explain your approach to solving this challenge*

I fixed the broken authentication middleware by introducing explicit checks for authError and user before proceeding with protected logic. The API now gracefully handles both authenticated and unauthenticated cases without crashing. I also added structured logging, proper status codes, and strong TypeScript types to ensure safer responses.

## Authentication Handling Strategy
*How did you handle undefined user scenarios?*

1. Checked the result of supabase.auth.getUser().
2. If authError is present → immediately returned 401 Unauthorized with an "Invalid token" message.
3. If no error but user is null → returned 401 Unauthorized with an "Unauthorized" message.
4. Only if a valid user object exists, I proceed with database queries.

## Error Handling Implementation
*How did you implement proper error handling?*

1. Wrapped logic in a try/catch block.
2. Logged errors using console.error and warnings with console.warn.
3. Handled three categories of errors:
    - Auth error (invalid token).
    - Unauthenticated user (missing user).
    - Database error (query failures).
4. Returned structured JSON error responses instead of crashing.

## HTTP Status Code Strategy
*How did you return appropriate HTTP status codes?*

1. 200 OK → Successful authenticated request with data.
2. 401 Unauthorized → Missing or invalid authentication.
3. 500 Internal Server Error → Database or unexpected errors.
Ensured each error path returned the correct code and message.

## TypeScript Implementation
*How did you implement proper TypeScript types?*

Created a ProtectedRouteResponse type with success, optional data, and optional error.
Used NextResponse.json<ProtectedRouteResponse>() for type-safe responses.
Declared explicit types for Supabase responses to avoid any.
Applied type narrowing when handling user and error from Supabase.

## Testing Strategy
*How did you test your solution?*

1. Created a ProtectedRouteResponse type with success, optional data, and optional error.
2. Used NextResponse.json<ProtectedRouteResponse>() for type-safe responses.
3. Declared explicit types for Supabase responses to avoid any.
4. Applied type narrowing when handling user and error from Supabase.
5. Additionally defined:
        export interface UserData {
        id: string
        user_id: string
        [key: string]: any
        }

        export interface ApiResponse {
        success: boolean
        data?: UserData[] | null
        error?: string
        }

This ensures both the data layer (UserData) and the API response layer (ApiResponse) are strongly typed and reusable across routes.

## Time Taken
*How long did this challenge take you to complete?*

1. It took around 2–3 hours including:
2. Fixing the authentication flow.
3. Implementing TypeScript types.
4. Writing Jest test cases with Supabase mocks.
5. Debugging log outputs and adjusting responses.
