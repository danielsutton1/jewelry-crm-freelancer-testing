# Challenge 3 Solution Explanation

## Your Solution
Completely rewrote the OrdersService to handle undefined data properly by always returning arrays instead of undefined values, implementing proper error handling with custom error classes, and adding input validation for all methods.

## Data Handling Strategy
The main issue was returning raw Supabase data which could be undefined. Fixed by using `data || []` for array methods and `data || null` for single item methods. This ensures the frontend never gets undefined values that cause map crashes.

## Error Handling Implementation
Created a custom OrdersServiceError class with error codes for different scenarios - database errors, invalid inputs, and unknown errors. Each method is wrapped in try-catch blocks that distinguish between expected and unexpected errors.

## TypeScript Implementation
Added proper types for Order interface and created a custom error class. Used strict typing for method parameters and return values to catch issues at compile time rather than runtime.

## Data Validation Approach
Added validation for method parameters - checking for empty strings, null values, and proper types before making database calls. This prevents database errors from invalid inputs.

## Testing Strategy
Tests cover all the edge cases that caused crashes - undefined data, database errors, empty results, and invalid inputs. Used proper error type checking rather than just catching generic errors.

## Time Taken
Around 25 minutes - most time spent on designing the error handling strategy and making sure all edge cases were covered.

## Questions or Clarifications
The original service was too minimal for production use. Added proper error boundaries and validation that would be expected in a real application. The custom error class makes it easier for consumers to handle different error scenarios appropriately.
