# Challenge 2 Solution Explanation

## Your Solution
Fixed the missing foreign key relationships in the communications table and updated the API query to properly join with users table. The main issue was that Supabase couldn't establish relationships without proper foreign key constraints.

## Database Relationship Fix
Added foreign key constraints linking sender_id and recipient_id to users.id with ON DELETE SET NULL to handle user deletions gracefully. Also created indexes on these columns and created_at for better query performance.

## API Query Fix
Updated the query syntax to use proper foreign key references (sender_id and recipient_id) instead of just table names. Fixed the select statement to be more explicit about which fields to return and added proper error handling for undefined data.

## Error Handling Strategy
Implemented proper HTTP status codes - 500 for database errors, 200 for successful requests including empty results. Added null checks for data and separated database errors from unexpected errors with different logging approaches.

## TypeScript Implementation
Created proper interfaces for User, Communication, and response types. Used generic ApiResponse type to ensure consistency across success and error responses. Made sender/recipient optional since they could be null if users are deleted.

## Testing Approach
Created tests covering successful requests, empty results, error handling, and response structure validation. Focused on testing the actual API behavior rather than mocking everything.

## Time Taken
About 30 minutes - spent most time figuring out the correct Supabase query syntax for the foreign key relationships.

## Questions or Clarifications
The original query was trying to use implicit relationships that didn't exist. With proper foreign keys, the query syntax needs to reference the actual column names that have the constraints.
