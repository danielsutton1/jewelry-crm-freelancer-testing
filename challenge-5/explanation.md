# Challenge 5 Solution Explanation

## Your Solution
Completely rebuilt the OrderAnalyticsService with comprehensive data validation, null safety, and error handling. Added validation methods to filter out invalid data rather than crashing on undefined values.

## Data Transformation Strategy
The main issue was trying to access properties on undefined or null objects. Added validation functions that check data integrity before processing - validateOrders ensures the input is an array, validateOrderItems filters out invalid items.

## Error Handling Implementation
Created custom AnalyticsError class for domain-specific errors with error codes. Used try-catch blocks around all calculations with specific error messages for different failure scenarios - invalid input vs calculation errors.

## Data Validation Approach
Added comprehensive validation for order items - checking for null values, negative prices/quantities, and missing required fields. Used filtering approach to remove invalid items rather than failing completely.

## TypeScript Implementation
Enhanced the type definitions with proper interfaces for all data structures. Added custom error class and used union types to handle nullable inputs. Made the service methods more type-safe with proper parameter and return types.

## Testing Strategy
Tests cover all the crash scenarios - undefined data, null items, invalid values, empty arrays. Added specific tests for edge cases like negative prices and malformed data structures.

## Time Taken
About 35 minutes - spent extra time on the validation logic and making sure all edge cases were properly handled.

## Questions or Clarifications
In production, you might want to add more sophisticated validation rules, logging for data quality issues, and possibly data transformation/cleanup capabilities. The current approach prioritizes safety over performance.
